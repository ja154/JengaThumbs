const baseInstruction = `You are an expert graphic designer creating a 16:9 YouTube thumbnail. The final image must be professional, high-resolution, and visually compelling. Key requirements are: 1) A clear, engaging subject. 2) Large, bold, and easily readable text that is a core part of the design. Crucially, all text must be perfectly spelled and clearly legible, with no merged or overlapping characters. 3) A dynamic composition that draws the viewer's eye. The specific art style is:`

      ${baseInstruction} a modern, high-impact style typical for popular YouTube creators. It must feature a clear, high-quality photo of a person with an expressive face, often looking towards the camera. The background should be clean, perhaps with a subtle gradient or texture, to ensure the subject pops. Text is crucial: it must be BIG, BOLD, and have extremely high contrast against the background. Use techniques like thick outlines or drop shadows to make the text readable at any size. The composition should be dynamic and draw the viewer's attention immediately.

      ${baseInstruction} a modern tech-anime style. The central focus is a charismatic anime-style character with clean, sharp lines, like vector art, typically positioned on the right side of the frame.

The scene is illuminated by vibrant neon lights, primarily in shades of cyan and magenta, which also create strong rim lighting on the character. The text uses a bold, sans-serif font, often stacked, and is colored with the same vibrant neon palette to ensure it stands out dramatically.
